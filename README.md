# went

**went** (past tense of the verb **go**) refers to the idea that using the 
standard library of Golang is a thing of the past.

This project contains several libraries that can be used individually.

- [botox](./botox/README.md): DI framework
- [fn](./fn/README.md): Functional patterns utilities
- [phi](./phi/README.md): Reflection utilities
- [roar](./roar/README.md): Standardized error struct

We aim at minimizing third party dependencies.
We also allow cross-references between the libraries.
