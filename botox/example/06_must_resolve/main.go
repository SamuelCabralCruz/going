	// This is the reason why we decided to expose the method `botox.MustResolve`.

	// The only difference with `botox.Resolve` is the fact that this method
	// will panic when an error would normally be returned.

	// Using this method, you might be able to simplify your application logic
	// instead of having to deal with errors returning functions when there is
	// no foreseeable recovery possible.

	// REGISTRATION
	// RESOLUTION
	botox.MustResolve[example.SomeStruct]() // -> should panic
}
